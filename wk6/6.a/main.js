        'Most herds of llamas are maintained by the Indians of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina.',
        'The llama is primarily a pack animal but is also used as a source of food, wool, hides, tallow for candles, and dried dung for fuel.',
        'The largest of the lamoids, it averages 120 cm (47 inches) at the shoulder. A 113-kilogram (250-pound) llama can carry a load of 45â€“60 kg and average 25 to 30 km (15 to 20 miles) travel a day.',
        'The llama is a gentle animal, but, when overloaded or maltreated, it will lie down, hiss, spit and kick, and refuse to move.'
